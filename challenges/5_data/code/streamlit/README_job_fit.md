# Job Fit - Talent Recommendation System

## Overview

A comprehensive Streamlit application that uses advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to match job descriptions with candidate profiles. Built on top of a TF-IDF vectorization system with Portuguese language processing.

## Features

### üîç Job Description Matching
- Input any job description and find the best matching candidates
- AI-powered similarity scoring
- Configurable match thresholds
- Detailed candidate profiles with skills preview

### üë• Similar Candidates
- Find candidates similar to existing profiles
- Useful for building teams or finding backup candidates
- Similarity scoring based on skills and experience

### üìä System Analytics  
- Real-time system metrics and performance data
- Candidate distribution visualizations
- Educational and professional level analysis
- Memory usage and vocabulary statistics

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **ML/NLP:** scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Language Processing:** NLTK, spaCy (Portuguese)
- **Visualization:** Plotly
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_job_fit.txt
```

2. Download required NLTK data:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('rslp')
```

3. Install spaCy Portuguese model:
```bash
python -m spacy download pt_core_news_sm
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run job_fit_app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. Choose your mode:
   - **Job Description Matching:** Enter job requirements to find matching candidates
   - **Similar Candidates:** Find candidates similar to existing profiles  
   - **System Analytics:** View system statistics and data distributions

## Data Requirements

The application expects the following pre-processed data files:

```
/data/gold/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ talent_vectorizer.pkl          # Pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ talent_pool_vectors_combined.parquet  # TF-IDF vectors for all candidates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ candidate_mapping.json         # Candidate index mapping

/data/silver/processed/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ application_processed.csv      # Cleaned candidate profiles
```
